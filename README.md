# WinRTOCR

A .net desktop ocr console application which uses windows runtime's Windows.Media.Ocr api.

About calling Windows Runtime (WinRT) API from .net desktop console application:

There are many posts about this, which is confusing.

* [Create a Universal Windows Platform console app](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/uwp/launch-resume/console-uwp). This creates a UWP app which needs installation.
* [Call Windows Runtime APIs in desktop apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-enhance). I installed Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Contracts, but it didn't work.
* [C#/WinRT](https://github.com/microsoft/cswinrt/blob/master/README.md). Didn't work.
* [How to use Windows.Devices.Geolocation API in a C# WinForm Win32 Desktop application in Windows 10?](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/40b4f86d-b6d5-430e-a235-7fc003dec4c4/how-to-use-windowsdevicesgeolocation-api-in-a-c-winform-win32-desktop-application-in-windows-10). This actually works. See the last post in 2019.
